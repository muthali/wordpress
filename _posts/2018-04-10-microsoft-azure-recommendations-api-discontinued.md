<strong>How does Expertrec recommendation engine work?</strong>

Expertrec recommendation engine works by learning from user behavior across your website, mobile and other channels.

You have to add expertrec's Javascript to your website. This Javascript learns from website user's behavior and creates user profiles and product profiles that are merged to generate recommendations.

On a high level two types of recommendations are generated-
<ol>
 	<li>Product to product/ Item to item recommendations (P2P)- This could be recommendations such as customers who viewed this item also viewed, similar products etc.</li>
 	<li>User to product recommendations (U2P)- Recommended for you, recently viewed etc.</li>
</ol>
These recommendations evolve in real time for every individual customer browsing on your website applications.

<strong>High level architecture-</strong>
