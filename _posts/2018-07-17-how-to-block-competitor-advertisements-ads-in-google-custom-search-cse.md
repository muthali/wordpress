One of the major disadvantages of using google custom search is that it shows ads on your website. What's worse? it can show competitor's ads on your website!!

For people looking to monetize your website (make money from google ads) this is a good option. But for people looking to use GCS for adding search functionality to their website, this is a bad option since it might redirect your hard earned traffic to your competitors.

Many website owners are not aware of this. Here is an example of VIT, an educational institution and a search query for "admission" brings competitor ads and search results from VIT are not even visible in the first fold.
