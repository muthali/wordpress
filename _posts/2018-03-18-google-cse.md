Google CSE - Custom search engine is a way you can add search to your website.  you can create a list of websites from which you want your search box to show results from.  This is a very quick and easy way to add search to your non-commercial site.  Did I say non-commercial website ?  Yes, this is great for non commercial site as Google will monetize by showing ads.

The ads might or might not be a bad Idea.  If you are a business and dont want to show ads to your user, then CSE is not for you.  For an affordable CSE alternative that is ad free, try our search solution.  Plan starting as low as 9$ per month.
