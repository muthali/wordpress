<span>Tracking site search on your wordpress site can deliver great insights into your customers’ minds.

<strong>Step 5</strong>- Enter query parameter. Usually for wordpress sites, query parameter is "s". Make a search query and see what your query parameter is. The term between <strong>?</strong> and <strong>=</strong> is your query parameter. In the below image "<strong>s</strong>" is the query parameter.<img src="https://blog.expertrec.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/para.png" alt="track wordpress search queries google analytics" width="777" height="576" class="aligncenter wp-image-1325 size-full" /><strong>Step 6</strong>-Enable site search categories.  If you have wordpress categories filter in your search results page, you can add the category paramter. It is usually "cat" for wordpress sites. In the following image as you can see the category parameter is "cat" since the category chosen is "Garden-stand" and query parameter is "s".
