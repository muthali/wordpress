<strong>What is google custom search?</strong>

Google custom search is a tool to add search functionality to your website. (this includes a search box, auto suggest, spell correct, search results pages). With google custom search, you can create a search for almost any website on the internet. This is done by adding a piece of code to your website. Google custom search is a free tool. How come this is free? Google shows ad in search results in your website. So if you are looking to make money through ads, this is a good option. There is also a downside, for example-if you are a university and people are searching for admissions, google might show a ton of ads on your website and you could risk losing your customers to competitors.

Google has given an option to prevent this from happening- <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/164657" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Block ads by advertiser URL</a>- There are two options-
<ol>
 	<li>Block ads at site level</li>
 	<li>Block ads at product level.</li>
</ol>

<strong>What is Google site search?</strong>

Google site search is similar to google custom search. The main differences are that Google site search is a paid tool and there is an option to choose whether you want to show ads or not. Also Google site search is shutting down as of April 2018. All google site search accounts will be converted into google custom search accounts. This means ads will start showing in your search results.

Main differences between Google custom search (GCS) and site search (GSS)-
<ol>
 	<li>GCS has ads that you cant remove but u can filter your competitor ads.</li>
 	<li>You cannot remove google branding in GCS.</li>
 	<li>No XML API Access in GCS.</li>
 	<li>JSON API has daily limits.</li>
 	<li>No technical support for GCS.</li>
</ol>
Now the big question- Which one should you go for? The answer is simple, if you are ok with ads, you can go for Google custom search. Moving to google site search is not an option since it is shutting down, but you could move to other search providers such as <a href="https://blog.expertrec.com/google-site-search-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expertrec</a> that provide ad free search results for a nominal monthly fee. Here is a custom implementation on PSIcompany.
